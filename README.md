# large_range_of_features_analyzer_and_predictor
The idea is to be able to group up many features together and predict them in the future for example. These without using any transformers, or attention model except this one. In fact, the idea in this project isn't to raise attention to something, but to find the most persistant feature that doesn't align with others for uniformization.

Fun fact :
I started about 10h p.m. to end up at 3h18 a.m. (the moment where I am writing this). 
I've study all the day, and it's a rare moment for me, to enjoy AI. 
I gonna sleep
